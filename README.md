# CityLibrary
City Library application build in JAVAFX


Objective:
The objective of this part of the project was to create a User Interface and implement the Library database,
so that the whole project functions from end-to-end.

Description of Implementation:
The project primarily required a GUI with a Menu, along with a SQL Database that would interface with the GUI through the use of an API.
MySQL was chosen to be the application to create the SQL server, and once the server was created,
registration information had to be stored in a registration table. Then JavaFx was used as a webserver to create the USer interface for the project.
Tables were created for each of the relations in the Entity-Relationship Diagram of the Library Database using Sql statements in the MySql Database.
All primary keys, and constraints were specified for proper implementation.
Then sample data was populated and the database was tested for further analysis.
Once the GUI was made, the application was tested to ensure proper functionality.
